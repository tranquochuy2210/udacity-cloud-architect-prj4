1. What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the
   internet-facing attack surface of the web application instance?

- Application Load Balancer should be configured to redirect all HTTP requests
  to HTTPS: Reconfigure the Application Load Balancer to redirect all HTTP
  requests to HTTPS
- Move the web application EC2 instance into a private subnet and use a NAT
  gateway


2. Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would
   creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the
   secrets bucket?

- Only for users who are not authenticated on the same account
- Those users can still access the S3 bucket through the VPC private endpoints


3. Will applying default encryption setting to the S3 buckets encrypt the data
   that already exists?

- No, applying default encryption setting to the S3 buckets does not encrypt the
  data that already exists
- It only applies to future uploads and existing objects must be re-uploaded


4. The changes you made above were done through the console or CLI; describe the
   outcome if the original CloudFormation templates are applied to this
   environment?

- The changes made through the console or the CLI would be reset to the settings
  from the original CloudFormation templates
