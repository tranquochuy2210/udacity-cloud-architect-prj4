1. Identify 2-3 changes that can be made to our environment to prevent an SSH
   brute force attack from the internet.

- Update the application server security group to only permit connections from
  the Application Load Balancer security group
- Disable SSH access by removing connections to port 22 from the application
  server security group
- Disable SSH password login on the application server instance


2. Neither instance should have had access to the secret recipes bucket; even in
   the instance that API credentials were compromised how could we have
   prevented access to sensitive data?

- Enforce default encryption through S3 bucket policy
- Restrict access to only specific IAM roles, i.e. using a new role specifically
  for accessing the S3 bucket (least privilege access)
