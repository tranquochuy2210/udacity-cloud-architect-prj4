Identify tools that will allow you to do the following: a. Scan infrastructure
as code templates. b. Scan AMI’s or containers for OS vulnerabilities. c. Scan
an AWS environment for cloud configuration vulnerabilities.

For each tool - identify an example compliance violation or vulnerability which
it might expose.


Scan infrastructure as code templates

- [Checkov](https://www.checkov.io/): Scans cloud infrastructure managed in
  Terraform, Cloudformation, Kubernetes, Arm templates or Serverless Framework
  and detects misconfigurations
- [TFLint](https://github.com/terraform-linters/tflint): Terraform linter
  focused on possible errors, best practices, etc.
- [Terrafirma](https://github.com/wayfair/terrafirma): Terraform static analysis
  tool designed for detecting security misconfigurations
- [Terrascan](https://www.accurics.com/products/terrascan/): Provides
  out-of-the-box policies so that you can scan IaC against common policy
  standards such as the CIS Benchmark
- [Cloudsploit](https://cloudsploit.com/cloudformation): Plugin-based scans, API
  access and web GUI
- [Cfripper](https://github.com/Skyscanner/cfripper): Library and CLI security
  analyzer for AWS CloudFormation templates

These tools help to detect misconfigurations such as too permissive security
groups, missing encryption settings, etc. before the infrastructure is deployed.


Scan AMI’s or containers for OS vulnerabilities

- [Anchore](https://anchore.com/): Inspects, analyzes, and certifies Docker
  images
- [Clair](https://github.com/quay/clair): Vulnerability scanner and static
  analysis tool for container images
- [Dagda](https://github.com/eliasgranderubio/dagda/): Performs static analysis
  of known vulnerabilities and uses the ClamAV anti-virus engine to scan and
  detect trojans, viruses, and malware contained within Docker images
- [OpenSCAP](https://www.open-scap.org/): Provides a set of tools for scanning
  and compliance management, including oscap-docker, which can scan a container
  image
- [Trivy](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy): Vulnerability scanner for
  containers and other artifacts

These tools scan containers for known vulnerabilities such as outdated operating
systems, applications and libraries, e.g.:
- Old operating systems known vulnerabilities
- Detecting trojans, viruses and malware


Scan an AWS environment for cloud configuration vulnerabilities

- [AWS GuardDuty](https://aws.amazon.com/guardduty/): Threat detection service
  that continuously monitors for malicious activity and unauthorized behavior to
  protect your AWS accounts, workloads, and data stored in Amazon S3
- [AWS Inspector](https://aws.amazon.com/inspector/): Automatically assesses applications for exposure,
  vulnerabilities, and deviations from best practices
- [AWS Security Hub](https://aws.amazon.com/security-hub/): Aggregates,
  organizes, and prioritizes security alerts, or findings, from multiple AWS
  services, such as Amazon GuardDuty, Amazon Inspector, Amazon Macie, AWS
  Identity and Access Management (IAM) Access Analyzer, and AWS Firewall
  Manager, as well as from AWS Partner solutions
- [AWS Config](https://aws.amazon.com/config/): Enables assessing, auditing, and
  evaluating the configurations of AWS resources
- [AWS CloudTrail](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/): Log, continuously
  monitor, and retain account activity related to actions across AWS
  infrastructure
- [Cloud Custodian](https://github.com/cloud-custodian/cloud-custodian): Rules
  engine for managing public cloud accounts and resources
- [Prowler](https://github.com/toniblyx/prowler): AWS account security
  configuration assessment, auditing, and hardening tool

These tools allow to continuously monitor for malicious activity and
unauthorized behavior to protect your AWS accounts, workloads, and data stored
in AWS services, e.g.:
- Weak password rules
- Violations of least priviledge
- Accounts without MFA
